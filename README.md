# Poker
I don't really know anything about poker but have made a hold'em poker variation. At the moment this is purely a terminal game.

# Functionality
* Two players currently (adding query for more inn soon)
* Stats, win rate, wins, losses and ties if that somehow occurs
* Clean UI in terminal
* Easy quitting

Originally this was just me doing task 54 from ProjectEuler.com but i misunderstood(i did not see the input file) and made a poker game instead.
